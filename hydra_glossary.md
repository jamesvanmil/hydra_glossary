#### Academic Preservation Trust
A consortium working towards creating and managing a repository to collect and preserve the academic and research output from it's member institutions. The Academic Preservation Trust repository will also be part of the Digital Preservation Network. The University of Cincinnati Libraries joined the Academic Preservation trust in #date. [http://aptrust.org/](http://aptrust.org/ )

#### ActiveFedora
A Ruby gem which gives objects in the Fedora Repository a Rails-friendly interface to help ease development. The gem is inspired by the ActiveModel gem, which makes it easy to work with databases in the Ruby on Rails framework.

#### Agile Development
A development practice that focuses on incremental and iterative development with adaptive planning, rather than trying to grapple with the full breadth of a development challenge ahead of beginning work. A key tenet of agile development is to select paths that will make future change easier, when faced with different design choices. Agile development is new to the UC Libraries and UCit, beginning with our work on Project Hydra.

#### API (or Application Programming Interface)
An interface that allows one program to talk to another program or web service to exchange information or to send commands. APIs allow the outside program to treat their targets like black boxes, which allows for easy compartmentalization of complex software.

#### Blacklight
A Rails gem which provides a discovery interface to the full-text search engine, Solr, and which is a standard part of any Hydra project, including our work at UC Libraries. Designed to accomodate hetrogenous data, Blacklight can be used to provide access to both print and digital library collections. [http://projectblacklight.org/](http://projectblacklight.org/)

#### CAS (Central Authentication Service)
A single sign on protocol for websites. One of many user authentication services used at UC.

#### Committers
In the parlance of agile development, Individuals who are authorized to contribute code (or commits) to a project, and who participate in the scrum development cycle. All Project Hydra committers have signed individual contributor licenses guaranteeing that their code commits are contributioned under an open source license

#### Controller
The C in MVC, controllers are the part of a web application that takes input from users or systems to make changes in the underlying models, datastores, or databases.

#### CRUD
Shorthand for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, these are the basic functions associated with storing digitial files.

#### Curate
The Hydra gem developed by Notre Dame University, now the core codebase for the Hydramata project. [https://github.com/projecthydra/curate ](https://github.com/projecthydra/curate)

#### Deployment
The process of installing a web application or stack of appllications into a production server environment. Our deployment environment for Hydra includes seperate virtual servers for the public web application, a testing website, and a development website.

#### Digital Preservation Network (DPN)
An organization created to provide digital preservation infrastructure for research-intensive academic member institutions. The Academic Preservation Trust repository will serve as a replicating node for DPN. Frequently pronounced like "deepen".

#### DSpace
A turnkey repository solution originally developed at MIT. DSpace is the software platform for the UC Libraries legacy repository, the Digital Resource Commons.

#### DuraSpace
A not for profit organization formed by the merger of the organizations responsible for DSpace and Fedora. DuraSpace provides the website where the communities around many repository and preservation open source development projects organize and communicate. DuraSpace is supported financially by sponsoring organizations, which include the University of Cincinnati Libraries.

#### Fedora Commons (or Fedora)
Orginally called Fedora (for Flexible Extensible Digital Object Repository Architecture), this digital asset manager is the core of the Hydra repository. The Fedora Commons architecture manages digital objects, auditing changes and controlling access. Development of Fedora is stewarded by Duraspace.

#### Framework
In website application development, a suite of tools which are packaged together to help to alleviate the overhead involved in developing an application. Ruby on Rails is a general framework for database-driven websites, and Hydra is a more specific framework for digital repository development.

#### Gem
In Ruby, a package of code that is packaged together for easy management and distribution. Gems may have dependecies on other gems, which may in turn depend on other gems.

#### Git
Version control software which allows a user to develop new software features on different branches of code without interfering with the stable code base. These seperate branches can be merged back into the master branch after the feature is developed and is working.

#### Github
A popular website for sharing code managed by Git software. UC has an institutional license for Github, to allow integration with teaching and learning at UC. [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

#### (RDF) Graph
One or many connected RDF statements. In a graph data, relationships are arbitrarily expressed through the relations descibed by the RDF statements, as opposed to though the structure of the a hierachical database.

#### Hydra
Hydra is a software framework, a organization of instutions (Hydra Partners), and a community of users (Hydra Adoptors). In the software framework context, Hydra is a set of gems that provide familiar, Ruby on Rails patterns for connecting Fedora to a Rails application, including connections to the Solr search platform through the Blacklight gem. Hydra software is maintained on Github at [https://github.com/projecthydra](https://github.com/projecthydra)

#### Hydra Adopters
Individuals or institutions who are using the Hydra framework without having joined the project as a partner. Developers working within this category are able to contribute to the project after signing agreements which ensure that the code they share is under an open source license.

#### Hydra Connect
An annual, open meeting of the Hydra community and anyone else intersted in Hydra. The meeting is a mix of community building, sharing, and development priority setting.

#### Hydra Partners
Institutions who have formally committed to further Hydra's goals, and who participate in governance and development of the Hydra code and community, whilst also working on their own Hydra development. The University of Cincinnati Libraries became a Hydra Partner in October 2012.

#### Hydramata
Formerly the Shared-IR project, Hydramata is a collaborative project between the University of Cincinnati, Northwestern University, the University of Notre Dame, Indiana University, and the University of Virgina. The project is currently focued on developing core institutional repository funcionality, expressed through the Curate gem. [https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydramata+Projectr](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydramata+Project)

#### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
A data format used to transmit human-readable data with machine-readable structure. JSON is commonly used in manipulating data for user interfaces. Tooling for parsing and creating JSON is easily available in all major programming languages.

#### (RDF) Literal
The use of human-friendly string as an element in an RDF triple (as opposed to the use of a URI, which is a reference to information stored elsewhere). For example, 'Cheese' is a literal value, and this is a URI for the same value in the Library of Congress Subject Headings: [http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85022845.html](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85022845.html)

#### Model
The central component and the M of MVC architecture, the model handles application data, and most of the logic of a web application. In Hydra, most of the modeling concerning applicaiton data uses the ActiveFedora gem.

#### MVC (or Model-view-controller)
A software pattern for implementing user interfaces. It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user. [Shamelessly lifted from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller). Ruby on Rails, and therefore Hydra, uses MVC architecture.
