<h4 id="agile-development">Agile Development</h4>
<p>A development practice that focuses on incremental and iterative development with adaptive planning, rather than trying to grapple with the full breadth of a development challenge ahead of beginning work.

<h4 id="api-or-application-programming-interface">API (or Application Programming Interface)</h4>

<h4 id="blacklight">Blacklight</h4>
<p>A Rails gem which provides a discovery interface to the full-text search engine, Solr, and which is a standard part of any Hydra project, including our work at UC Libraries.

<h4 id="section"></h4>
<p>Committers - In the parlance of agile development, Individuals who are authorized to contribute code (or commits) to a project, and who participate in the scrum development cycle. All Project Hydra committers have signed individual contributor licenses guaranteeing that their code commits are contributioned under an open source license</p>
<h4 id="controller">Controller</h4>

<h4 id="deployment">Deployment</h4>
<p>The process of installing a web application or stack of appllications into a production server environment. Our deployment environment for Hydra includes seperate virtual servers for the public web application, a testing website, and a development website.</p>
<h4 id="digital-preservation-network-dpn">Digital Preservation Network (DPN)</h4>
<p>An organization created to provide digital preservation infrastructure for research-intensive academic member institutions. The Academic Preservation Trust repository will serve as a replicating node for DPN. Frequently pronounced like &quot;deepen&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="dspace">DSpace</h4>
<p>A turnkey repository solution originally developed at MIT. DSpace is the software platform for the UC Libraries legacy repository, the Digital Resource Commons.</p>
<h4 id="duraspace">DuraSpace</h4>
<p>A not for profit organization formed by the merger of the organizations responsible for DSpace and Fedora. DuraSpace provides the website where the communities around many repository and preservation open source development projects organize and communicate. DuraSpace is supported financially by sponsoring organizations, which include the University of Cincinnati Libraries.</p>
<h4 id="fedora-commons-or-fedora">Fedora Commons (or Fedora)</h4>
<p>Orginally called Fedora (for Flexible Extensible Digital Object Repository Architecture), this digital asset manager is the core of the Hydra repository. The Fedora Commons architecture manages digital objects, auditing changes and controlling access. Development of Fedora is stewarded by Duraspace.</p>
<h4 id="framework">Framework</h4>
<p>In website application development, a suite of tools which are packaged together to help to alleviate the overhead involved in developing an application. Ruby on Rails is a general framework for database-driven websites, and Hydra is a more specific framework for digital repository development.</p>
<h4 id="gem">Gem</h4>
<p>In Ruby, a package of code that is packaged together for easy management and distribution. Gems may have dependecies on other gems, which may in turn depend on other gems.</p>
<h4 id="git">Git</h4>
<p>Version control software which allows a user to develop new software features on different branches of code without interfering with the stable code base. These seperate branches can be merged back into the master branch after the feature is developed and is working.</p>
<h4 id="github">Github</h4>
<p>A popular website for sharing code managed by Git software. UC has an institutional license for Github, to allow integration with teaching and learning at UC. <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a></p>
<h4 id="rdf-graph">(RDF) Graph</h4>
<p>One or many connected RDF statements. In a graph data, relationships are arbitrarily expressed through the relations descibed by the RDF statements, as opposed to though the structure of the a hierachical database.</p>
<h4 id="hydra">Hydra</h4>
<p>Hydra is a software framework (Hydra Head), a organization of instutions (Hydra Partners), and a community of users (Hydra Adoptors). In the software framework context, Hydra is a set of gems that provide familiar, Ruby on Rails patterns for connecting Fedora to a Rails application, including connections to the Solr search platform through the Blacklight gem.</p>
<h4 id="hydra-adopters">Hydra Adopters</h4>
<p>Individuals or institutions who are using the Hydra framework without having joined the project as a partner. Developers working within this category are able to contribute to the project after signing agreements which ensure that the code they share is under an open source license.</p>
<h4 id="hydra-connect">Hydra Connect</h4>
<p>An annual, open meeting of the Hydra community and anyone else intersted in Hydra. The meeting is a mix of community building, sharing, and development priority setting.</p>
<h4 id="hydra-partners">Hydra Partners</h4>
<p>Institutions who have formally committed to further Hydra's goals, and who participate in governance and development of the Hydra code and community, whilst also working on their own Hydra development. The University of Cincinnati Libraries became a Hydra Partner in October 2012.</p>
<h4 id="hydramata">Hydramata</h4>
<p>Formerly the Shared-IR project, Hydramata is a collaborative project between the University of Cincinnati, Northwestern University, the University of Notre Dame, Indiana University, and the University of Virgina.
